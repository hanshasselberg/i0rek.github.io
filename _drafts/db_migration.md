# Extracting Subtasks from the Tasks Database

Hello,

We want you to know that this is going to happen soon. Schlubbi et al worked on that for a long time and we are confident that we are closer than we’ve ever been. This migration is going to be very boring. Our goal is that it will go by unnoticed. We want to be able to flip the switch without telling anybody. To archive that we have a very strict protocol of what we do which includes every step that is necessary to roll back. We also have a very strict timeframe, it will not take longer than 10 minutes. No matter what.
You’ll receive another email describing what we did in particular. We are looking forward to it! 

Thanks,
Hans

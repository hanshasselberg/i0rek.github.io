I am concerned about privacy a lot lately and I would like to share what I am doing in order to protect it better. 

__TLDR__; I have as little data on other peoples computers aka the cloud as possible.

### Offline

There is only one thing I did in my offline life but I am mentioning it first because it feels like most important thing to me: __paying cash__. As a result I am visiting ATMs way more often now and I am also keeping track of my expenses in a [notebook]

### Online

At first I deleted lots and lots accounts from services I don’t use any more including Facebook, Dropbox and Yahoo. Then I moved to one timepasswords for the rest. Then I told everybody to use an email address from a domain I own: me@hans.io. Because ultimately I don’t want to use Gmail anymore. I migrated my emails to fastmail and when enough people knew about my new email I deleted every google account I have. Except for the one I have to use for work.

The downside of not having Dropbox is that I need to backup my data. I have two seperate encrypted disks, one is used for [TimeMachine] and the other one [SuperDuper!]. Additionally I am using [Arq] to store an encrypted Backup on AWS Glacier.

On my telephone (a Nexus 4) is [Cyanogenmod] with a throwaway Google account. I am using the [PrivacyGuard] for _every_ app. For my next phone I am going to follow this [article](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy) from the Tor people though.

I am manually sharing my contacts between devices, my files with a USB-stick and my calendar is only on my laptop.

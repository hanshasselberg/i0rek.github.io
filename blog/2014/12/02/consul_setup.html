  <h2>Setting up Consul on AWS</h2>
  <p><small>02 Dec 2014</small></p>
  </header>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>I wanted to extend the <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/">6Wunderkinder</a> infrastructure with service discovery and improve the health checks. For these goals <a href="https://consul.io">Consul</a> seemed like a very good fit. Getting the <a href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/http.html#kv">key/value store</a> was just the icing. In the following, I will explain the setup, things I’ve run into and share the configuration. I was looking for such a description myself and couldn’t find one.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-with-consul">First steps with Consul</h2>

<p>The first feature of Consul I used was the KV store. During provisioning of the instances I used Consul to set up credentials for database access. It was running for quite some time before I started integrating services and health checks. When I did that, I noticed two problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Foreign nodes in the cluster <strong>which turned out to be my fault</strong></li>
  <li>Unrelieable joining and leaving of nodes</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-foreign-nodes">1. Foreign nodes</h3>

<p>This was a really strange and scary thing. I only discovered it by going through the list of nodes manually with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consul members</code>. The Consul setup is in public AWS EC2. Not every port was properly protected by AWS Security groups. That was the first thing I changed. I created a dedicated <a href="https://gist.github.com/i0rek/370eee40379668983455">AWS Security Group</a>, in which I opened every port mentioned in the <a href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/options.html">docs at the very bottom</a> to itself. Now every server and client must have this group in order to participate. I also enabled <a href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html">encryption</a> and <a href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html">TLS</a> with this <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-consul-with-tls-encryption-on-ubuntu-14-04">help</a>. I should’ve done that in the first place and you should too.</p>

<h3 id="2-unrelieable-joining-and-leaving-of-nodes">2. Unrelieable joining and leaving of nodes</h3>

<p>Whenever I inspected <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consul monitor</code> pages of output were flying by and I thought that is normal. I learned it is not. I was running into a problem and after giving it some thought, <a href="https://twitter.com/armon">Armon</a> from Hashicorp was able to identify and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist/commit/63ef41a08f845463ae968b58ca4927666ccc1f4e">fix</a> it. Turns out the Serf event bus was saturated. The lesson here is that you should always be <a href="https://consul.io/docs/agent/telemetry.html">monitoring</a> because then the problem would’ve been easy to spot. I should’ve done that in the first place and you should too.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>As promised I’ve uploaded the <a href="https://gist.github.com/i0rek/d8ed565f79d9c250004d">configuration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The cluster is stable and everything works as expected. I am looking forward to put Consul to its use: orchestration. I want to thank <a href="http://torsten.io">Torsten</a> for his great feedback on this post! Thanks for reading.</p>
